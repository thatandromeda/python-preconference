python-preconference
====================

For organizing &amp; developing materials for the Python preconference the interest group is teaching at ALA Annual 2013.  Others are encouraged to use this too!

The curriculum is adapted from that of the [Boston Python Workshop](https://openhatch.org/wiki/Boston_Python_Workshop_7).  The stylesheet is liberally stolen from [Railsbridge](http://installfest.railsbridge.org/curriculum/).
