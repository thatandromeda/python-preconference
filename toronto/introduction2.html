                            That's right: booleans aren't just for librarians with mad ninja OPAC skills.  Programmers use them too.  Constantly.

                            So far, the code we've written has been unconditional: no choice is getting made, and the code is always run. Python has another data type called a <span class="stickynote">boolean</span> that is helpful for writing code that makes decisions. There are two booleans: <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>.

                            You can test if Python objects are equal or unequal. The result is a boolean:

                            That was our first multi-line piece of code, and the way to enter it at a Python prompt is a little different. First, type the <code>if 6 > 5:</code> part, and press Enter. The next line will have <code>...</code> as a prompt, instead of the usual >>>. This is Python telling us that we are in the middle of a <span class="stickynote">code block</span>, and so long as we indent our code it should be a part of this code block.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Enter 4 spaces, and then type <code>print "Six is greater than five!"</code>  Press Enter to end the line, and press Enter again to tell Python you are done with this code block. All together, it will look like this:
                    </div>
                    <div class="console">
                        <span></span>
                        <pre>>>> if 6 > 5:
...      print "Six is greater than five!"
... 
Six is greater than five!</pre>

                    <div class="message">
                        <p>
                            What is going on here? When Python encounters the if keyword, it evaluates the expression following the keyword and before the colon. If that expression is <b>True</b>, Python executes the code in the indented code block under the if line. If that expression is <b>False</b>, Python skips over the code block.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this case, because 6 really is greater than 5, Python executes the code block under the if statement, and we see "Six is greater than five!" printed to the screen. Guess what will happen with these other expressions, then type them out and see if your guess was correct:

                        <p>
                            We talked a bit about functions when we introduced the <code>len()</code> and <code>type()</code> functions. Let's review what we know about functions:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They do some useful bit of work.</li>
                            <li>They let us re-use code without having to type it out each time.</li>
                            <li>They take input and possibly produce output (we say they <span class="stickynote">return</span> a value). You can assign a variable to this output.</li>
                            <li>You call a function by using its name followed by its <span class="stickynote">arguments</span> in parentheses.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            For example:
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="console">
                        <span></span>
                        <pre>length = len("Mississippi")</pre>
                    </div>
                    <div class="message">
                        <p>
                            Executing this code assigns the length of the string "Mississippi" to the variable <code>length</code>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We can write our own functions to encapsulate bits of useful work so we can reuse them. Here's how you do it:
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Step 0: Think about what your function should do and what its arguments should be</h2>
                    <div class="message">
                        <p>
                            Arguments are information your function needs to have to complete its work.  Sometimes they help the function make choices: <code>is_it_yummy("chocolate")</code> might return <code>True</code>, whereas <code>is_it_yummy("snozzberries")</code> might return <code>False</code>.  Sometimes the arguments will be changed by the function. Imagine the function <code>weed(collection)</code>.  Our <code>collection</code> will probably be different before and after we run <code>weed()</code>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Deciding what your arguments should be is an important part of writing functions.  What information or procedures are <i>the same every time</i>?  That should be part of the function's internal logic; it doesn't need an argument for things that never change.  What varies?  That may need to be an argument.  (In our <code>weed()</code> example, you may have a standard set of rules you apply every time you weed a collection, but the collection that you're weeding is different each time.  <code>weed()</code> contains the standard rules; <code>collection</code> is the argument you need for the function to make sense.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You also need to think about what <i>kind of things</i> your function does stuff to.  For instance, how does <code>weed(collection)</code> work?  It might be able to do things to a collection of books, or DVDs, or magazines using pretty much the same rules (about age, quality, relevance, etc.).  Or maybe you actually need slightly different rules (you keep books longer than magazines).  Depending on how different, this might mean that you have some if/then rules inside your function, or it might be easier to write different functions (<code>weed_books(collection)</code>, <code>weed_magazines(collection)</code>).  Does <code>weed(collection)</code> also work if you feed it a collection of art? Of stamps? Of zombies?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There's no right or wrong answer, as long as the function you write solves your problem.  But you do need to be able to state clearly what the problem is.  It's also a good idea to write a comment inside your function, explaining briefly to future programmers (including yourself in six months!) what this function does, what kind of input it expects, and what kind of output it provides.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Step 1: Write a function signature</h2>
                    <div class="message">
                        <p>
                            A <span class="stickynote">function signature</span> tells you how the function will be called. It starts with the keyword <code>def</code>, which tells Python that you are defining a function. Then comes a space, the name of your function, an open parenthesis, the comma-separated input arguments for your function, a close parenthesis, and a colon. Here's what a function signature looks like for a function that takes no arguments:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <code>def myFunction():</code>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here's what a function signature looks like for a function that takes one argument called <code>string</code>:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <code>def myFunction(string):</code>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And one for a function that takes two arguments:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <code>def myFunction(myList, myInteger):</code>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Arguments should have names that usefully describe what they are used for in the function.  Functions should (unlike <code>myFunction()</code>) have descriptive names, too.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Step 2: do useful work inside the function</h2>
                    <div class="message">
                        <p>
                            Underneath the function signature you do your useful work. Everything inside the function is indented, just like with if/else blocks, so Python knows that it is a part of the function.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can use the variables passed into the function as arguments, just like you can use variables once you define them outside of functions.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="console">
                        <pre>def add(x, y):
    result = x + y</pre>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Step 3: return something</h2>
                    <div class="message">
                        <p>
                            If you want to be able to assign the output of a function to a variable so you can use it later, the function has to <b>return that output</b> using the return keyword.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <p>
                            or, even shorter:

                        <p>
                            Once you execute a return, you are done with the function -- you don't get to do any more work. That means if you have a function like this...
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="console">
                        <pre>def absoluteValue(number):
    if number < 0:

                    <div class="message">

                            ...if <code>number</code> is less than 0, you return number * -1 and never even get to the last line of the function. However, if <code>number</code> is greater than or equal to 0, the <code>if</code> expression evaluates to <code>False</code>, so we skip the code in the <code>if</code> block and return <code>number</code>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We could have written the above function like this if we wanted. It's the same logic, just more typing:
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="console">

                            There's usually more than one right way to write a program (that is, it runs and does the thing it's supposed to do).  Sometimes one of them may be better (e.g. it runs faster or is easier to read and modify), but some differences are purely a matter of personal style.  As we write more complicated programs later today, you might enjoy comparing notes with your neighbors and seeing the different ways you've attacked the same problem.

                            will print <code>x + y</code> to the screen so your eyes can see it.

                            will hand off <code>x + y</code> from inside the function to outside the function. This allows you to do something like:
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="console">
                        <pre>result = add(5, 6)
print result</pre>

                    <div class="message">
                        <p>
                            Does that make sense? If not, talk about it with a neighbor or staff member.

                            Congratulations! You've learned about and practiced executing Python scripts, booleans, conditionals, and if/else blocks, and you've written your own Python functions. This is a huge, huge accomplishment!
                        </p>

                            Take a break, stretch, meet some neighbors, and ask the staff if you have any questions about this material.
